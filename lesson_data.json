    "DIVISION": "T",
    "Period": 2,
    "TOPIC and LEARNING OBJECTIVE": "Identify Big and small force",
    "1. Managing conducive learning environment - RATING": 3,
    "1. Managing conducive learning environment - JUSTIFICATION": "The learning environment was partly conducive. The teacher showed care and concern, particularly when a child felt sick, which reflected positive teacher-student relationships. However, classroom management strategies were inconsistent. Students were not adequately trained to follow classroom rules and expectations, and transitions between activities lacked smoothness despite the effective use of countdowns.",
    "2. Active Learning - RATING": 4,
    "2. Active Learning - JUSTIFICATION": "Active learning was limited during the lesson. The teacher mainly relied on PowerPoint slides and verbal questioning, which restricted student participation and hands-on engagement. There were no experiments, demonstrations, or opportunities for students to explore forces through play or practical activities. The absence of CHAMPS routines and random student selection further reduced active participation, as only a few students were engaged in answering questions.",
    "3. Technology and resources utilization: - RATING": 3,
    "3. Technology and resources utilization: JUSTIFICATION": "Technology was used through a PowerPoint presentation and a video clip. However, the use of technology was not effective in supporting learning. The video clip, though relevant, was not integrated meaningfully into the discussion or followed by questioning to assess understanding. The technology was used more as a presentation tool rather than an interactive learning resource.",
    "4. Effective Assessment: - RATING": 4,
    "4. Effective Assessment:  JUSTIFICATION": "Assessment for learning was weak. Questioning strategies did not effectively check for understanding or encourage higher-order thinking. There was little evidence of formative assessment—no use of exit tickets, mini whiteboards, or oral reflection to gauge students’ grasp of “big and small forces.” Student responses were limited and not used to adjust teaching during the lesson.",
    "5. Differentiation - RATING": 4,
    "5. Differentiation:  JUSTIFICATION": "Differentiation was partially evident. During the group activity, students were able to complete differentiated tasks collaboratively, showing some understanding of the concept. However, differentiation in instruction and assessment was minimal. The teacher did not provide varied levels of support, scaffolding, or extension tasks to meet individual student needs.",
    "6. Timely and constructive feedback to students of varying needs - RATING": 4,
    "6. Timely and constructive feedback to students of varying needs -  JUSTIFICATION": "Feedback was minimal and mostly general (“Good job,” “Well done”). There were no specific comments guiding students toward improvement or reinforcing correct understanding. The lack of independent work further limited opportunities for the teacher to give individualized feedback.",
    "7. Provides Challenge for all students - RATING": 4,
    "7. Provides Challenge for all students - JUSTIFICATION": "The lesson provided limited challenge. Tasks were mostly teacher-directed, and questioning did not stretch student thinking. There were few opportunities for inquiry, prediction, or reasoning related to the forces topic. Students were not encouraged to apply knowledge independently or creatively.",
    "8. Progress in lessons and learning skills: - RATING": 4,
    "8. Progress in lessons and learning skills: JUSTIFICATION": "Students’ progress was inconsistent due to the passive nature of learning activities. While group discussions allowed for some peer interaction, the lack of hands-on exploration and effective assessment limited measurable learning outcomes. The lesson pace fluctuated, resulting in some parts being rushed and others too slow for sustained engagement.",
    "9. Students show self-confidence, and the ability to seize opportunities, leadership, and initiative demonstrated  - RATING": 4,
    "9. Students show self-confidence, and the ability to seize opportunities, leadership, and initiative demonstrated  - JUSTIFICATION": "Students had few chances to demonstrate leadership. With no random selection, hands-on tasks, or student-led discussions, leadership and initiative were minimal. Group work offered limited scope for collaborative leadership roles.",
    "10. Class Management: - RATING": 3,
    "10. Class Management: - JUSTIFICATION": "Classroom management was partially effective. While the teacher maintained general order, students were not well-practiced in routines or expectations. The CHAMPS strategy was not applied, which led to unclear behavioral expectations. However, the teacher’s calm demeanor and use of countdown transitions helped maintain some level of structure.",
    "TEACHING LEARNING and ASSESSMENT": 4,
    "ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT": 4,
    "PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING": 3,
    "OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS": 4,
    "POSITIVE COMMENTS": "Teacher demonstrated care and empathy toward students, particularly in addressing individual needs.\n\nEffective countdown strategy used for smooth transitions between activities.\n\nCollaborative group activity allowed students to engage in discussion and teamwork.\n\nUse of visual resources (PowerPoint and video) showed attempt to integrate technology.",
    "AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT": "Incorporate CHAMPS strategy to establish clear behavioral and participation expectations.\n\nIncrease active learning opportunities—include hands-on experiments and exploration.\n\nEnhance questioning techniques to promote critical thinking and assess understanding.\n\nIntegrate technology purposefully—use interactive videos or digital simulations meaningfully.\n\nProvide constructive feedback tailored to individual student responses.\n\nEnsure consistent lesson pacing and smooth transitions throughout.\n\nFoster student leadership and independence through student-led tasks or demonstrations.\n\nImplement clear classroom rules and routines for improved management and focus.\n\nDifferentiate instruction and assessment to meet diverse learning needs.\n\nEncourage reflection and self-assessment to promote metacognitive skills."

The task and the overall objective were centered on building confidence suggests this is a key focus and outcome.",
    "10. Class Management: - RATING": 1,
    "10. Class Management: - JUSTIFICATION": "Instructions were clear (\"Put your pens down,\" \"4 mins to practice with the pair\").

Well-being was integrated through recognising emotions associated with rewards.\n12. Instructions for activities were clear, structured, and easy to follow.",
    "AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT": "1. Classroom rule-following was inconsistent; students required frequent discipline.\n2. High noise levels affected focus; teacher used shouting and table-banging instead of positive attention signals.\n3. Students were passive when only one child was solving on the board; they need to work simultaneously in whiteboards.\n4. Materials were not prepared in advance, slowing transitions.\n5. Explanation of key concepts was incomplete (e.g., What is a word problem? How to identify keywords?).\n6. Students needed more opportunities to read, comprehend, and interpret word problems independently.\n7. Behaviour interruptions limited the amount of individual feedback the teacher could provide.\n8. Challenge for higher-ability learners can be increased further.\n9. Some well-being elements were rushed and could be paced better.\n10.

The use of varied questioning techniques, targeting specific students, promoted active engagement and provided timely feedback on key mathematical concepts like perimeter and exponents. The class environment was conducive and focused.",
    "AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT": "DIFFERENTIATION: Introduce more explicitly differentiated tasks. For example, include a column in the 3D shape table for Euler's formula as an extension task, or provide different levels of complexity for the Mensuration problems to challenge the most able students.\n\nACTIVE LEARNING: Shift from primarily teacher-led correction/questioning to more student-led activities, such as having students present their solution workings for Indices or having pairs design a quiz on the properties of 2D shapes.\n\nPERSONAL DEVELOPMENT: Encourage student initiative beyond answering direct questions. For instance, ask volunteers to lead the correction of a section or use a Think-Pair-Share strategy to foster collaboration and self-confidence."
